## **Overview**
This project provides a Python-based solution for processing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data. It is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to visualize and interact with the data. The script includes functionalities for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

---

## **Features**
- **Automated LULC Processing**: Extracts LULC information from multiple raster files.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes all LULC TIFF files in a folder automatically.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Reads and cleans LULC data using shapefiles for region selection.
- **Visualization**: Generates time-series plots and maps to display LULC changes.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates land cover changes, impervious surface values, and runoff coefficients.
- **Excel Output**: Saves LULC analysis results in a structured Excel file.
- **Image Output**: Produces summary plots showing year-by-year LULC trends.

## **Installation**
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LULC-Processor-Python-Script.git

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd LULC-Processor-Python-Script

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## **Usage**

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code Editor.
2. Open **LULC_Processor.ipynb** in Jupyter.
3. Run the cells step by step to:
   - Load and preprocess LULC data.
   - Perform analysis and extract statistics.
   - Visualize results.
   - Export Excel and image outputs.

---

## **Data Requirements**

1. **LULC Raster Files:** TIFF format (2001-2023) stored in a folder.
2. **Shapefile:** Defines the study area for spatial selection.
3. **Projection:** Ensure raster files have a common coordinate system.

---

## **Output**

1. Excel File (**LULC_Analysis.xlsx**)
2. **LULC Change Plot** (LULC_Change.png): A multi-year comparison plot showing land use transitions.
3. Maps: Color-coded maps highlighting **LULC changes** over time.
